## About

Flutter Sweep cleans all your Flutter projects on your device at once, so that you would have more free space on hard drive.

## Installation

```
dart pub global activate fluttersweep
```
Then use it in your terminal like that (It scans the whole file system automatically):

```
fluttersweep
```

## Notes

* You need to have `flutter` command added to your PATH.
* This package is optimized for speed, it only cleans a flutter project with build files inside. So if you have a project with no build files, it considered already clean.
